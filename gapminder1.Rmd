## Question One

```{r}
data = gapminder
gapminder1 = data%>%
  filter(year == 1997, continent == "Americas")%>%
  arrange(desc(lifeExp))%>%
  mutate(logpop = log(pop))

ggplot(data = gapminder1, mapping = aes( x = lifeExp, y = country, 
                                         fill = country)) +
geom_bar(stat = "identity")
